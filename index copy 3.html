      <h3>Image Manipulation</h3>
      <p>What I learned from image manipulation is that you can merge layers together to make one desired image. You can change how the image looks by using special tools and other images. You can also blend images together and add alpha layers. You can make backgrounds and color to your pages. If you want to rotate or change how the image looks you change the image with tools selected and the layer selected. Image manipulation is very helpful and can be used to create amazing and complex photos. What I liked the most about Image manipulation is being able to create an image and adding anything I want. I could create anything and I it also helped me a lot on homework assignments. I think image manipulation was really fun and interesting to learn. I will continue to use programs like gimp and photoshop for editing for the future homework and work. I learned a lot from programs like gimp and photoshop. I mainly used gimp and learned that I can edit and change how an image looks. It will really help with work assignments.</p>

      <h3>3D Models</h3>
      <p> I learned how to 3d model. I used programs like blender and unreal 4. I was able to export files into unreal4 from blender. I could create houses and models that could create a basic atmosphere. Than I could also add textures to the models. Making my projects look realistic. I could use 3d model in lots of classes. I could use 3d model in science to create a biosphere. I could use it in history to create a battle field. Also I could make a design for tsa. I could use unreal4 in classes for science to create a landscape for weather. For language arts I could make a scene in a book. For history I could also create a battle field from unreal4. Last, I could make a animation in unreal4 for tsa. The assignment I liked the most from 3d modeling was creating the snowman. I liked this because it was interesting learning the tools and how to use blender. </p>

      <h3>Round Robin</h3>
      <p>In Round Robin I had to make a website about mt. st. Helens. Also I made a website on the movie, "The Titanic." I enjoyed doing both projects and was able to learn a lot about coding. Also in Round Robin I could use it in other classes and learned </p>

      <h3>Hardware Chart</h3>
      <p>I expect to learn more about how the computer is programed and created. I want to understand the basic softwares needed for the computer. Also I want to see how the computer can be fixed and reprogramed. I was able to learn this when we did projects on hardware. I now understand more how a computer works.</p>
